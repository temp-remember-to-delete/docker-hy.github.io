Defining DevOps is not a trivial task but the term itself consists of two parts, <em>Dev</em> and <em>Ops</em>. <em>Dev</em> refers to the development of software and <em>Ops</em> to operations. Simple definition for DevOps would be that it means the release, configuring, and monitoring of software is in the hands of the very people who develop it.</p><p>A more formal definition is offered by <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2962707\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jabbari et al.</a>: \"DevOps is a development methodology aimed at bridging the gap between Development and Operations, emphasizing communication and collaboration, continuous integration, quality assurance and delivery with automated deployment utilizing a set of development practices\".</p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Devops-toolchain.svg\"><p>Image of DevOps toolchain by Kharnagy from <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Devops-toolchain.svg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wikipedia</a></p><p><em>Sometimes</em> DevOps is regarded as a role that one person or a team can fill.

You need to deploy them to a server that already has an application requiring Python 2.7 and of course none of your applications are 2.7. What do you do?</p><p>Since containers package the software with all of its dependencies, you package the existing app and all 5 new ones with their respective python versions and that's it.</p><p>I can only imagine the disaster that would result if you try to run them side by side on the same machine without isolating the environments. It sounds more like a time bomb. Sometimes different parts of a system may change over time, possibly leading to the application not working. These changes may be anything from an operating system update to changes in dependencies.</p><h3 id=\"scenario-3-development\" style=\"position:relative;\">Scenario 3: Development<a href=\"#scenario-3-development\" aria-label=\"scenario 3 development permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3><p>You are brought into a dev team.

Running software on top of containers is almost as efficient as running it \"natively\" outside containers, at least when compared to virtual machines.</p><p>So containers have a direct access to your own Operating Systems kernel and resources. The resource usage overhead of using containers is minimized, as the applications behave as if there were no extra layers. As Podman is using Linux kernels, Mac and Windows can't run it without a few hoops and each have their own solutions on how to run Podman.</p><h2 id=\"running-containers\" style=\"position:relative;\">Running containers<a href=\"#running-containers\" aria-label=\"running containers permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2><p>You already have Podman installed so let's run our first container!</p><p>The hello-world is a simple application that outputs \"Hello from Podman!\" and some additional info.</p><p>Simply run <code class=\"language-text\">podman container run hello-world</code>, the output will be the following:</p><div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"console\"><pre class=\"language-console\"><code class=\"language-console\">$ podman container run hello-world\n  Unable to find image &#39;hello-world:latest&#39; locally\n  latest: Pulling from library/hello-world\n  b8dfde127a29: Pull complete\n  Digest: sha256:308866a43596e83578c7dfa15e27a73011bdd402185a84c5cd7f32a88b501a24\n  Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest\n\n  Hello from Podman!\n  This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.\n\n  To generate this message, Podman took the following steps:\n   1.

When you run a command, e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">podman container run</code>, behind the scenes the client sends a request through the REST API to the <strong>podman daemon</strong> which takes care of images, containers and other resources.</p><p>You can read the <a href=\"https://docs.podman.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">docs for more information</a>. But even though you will find over 50 commands in the documentation, only a handful of them is needed for general use.

For example, if a container's ID is 3d4bab29dd67, you can use <code class=\"language-text\">podman container rm 3d</code> to delete it. Using the shorthand for the ID will not delete multiple containers, so if you have two IDs starting with 3d, a warning will be printed, and neither will be deleted. You can also use multiple arguments: <code class=\"language-text\">podman container rm id1 id2 id3</code></p><p>If you have hundreds of stopped containers and you wish to delete them all, you should use <code class=\"language-text\">podman container prune</code>. Prune can also be used to remove \"dangling\" images with <code class=\"language-text\">podman image prune</code>. Dangling images are images that do not have a name and are not used. They can be created manually and are automatically generated during build. Removing them just saves some space.</p><p>And finally you can use <code class=\"language-text\">podman system prune</code> to clear almost everything. We aren't yet familiar with the exceptions that <code class=\"language-text\">podman system prune</code> does not remove.</p><p>After removing all of the <em>hello-world</em> containers, run <code class=\"language-text\">podman image rm hello-world</code> to delete the image.
