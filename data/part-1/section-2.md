Next we will start using a more useful image than hello-world. We can run ubuntu just with `podman run ubuntu`.

```console
$ podman run ubuntu
  Unable to find image 'ubuntu:latest' locally
  latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu
  83ee3a23efb7: Pull complete
  db98fc6f11f0: Pull complete
  f611acd52c6c: Pull complete
  Digest: sha256:703218c0465075f4425e58fac086e09e1de5c340b12976ab9eb8ad26615c3715
  Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:latest
```

Anticlimactic as nothing really happened. The image was downloaded and ran and that was the end of that. It actually tried to open a shell but we will need to add a few flags to interact with it. `-t` will create a tty.

```console
$ podman run -t ubuntu
  root@f83969ce2cd1:/#
```

Now we're inside the container and if we input `ls` and press enter... nothing happens. Because our terminal is not sending the messages into the container. The `-i` flag will instruct to pass the STDIN to the container. If you're stuck with the other terminal you can just stop the container.

```console
$ podman run -it ubuntu
  root@2eb70ecf5789:/# ls
  bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib32  lib64  libx32  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
```

Great! Now we know at least 3 useful flags. `-i` (interactive), `-t` (tty) and `-d` (detached).

Let's throw in a few more and run a container in the background:

```console
$ podman run -d -it --name looper ubuntu sh -c 'while true; do date; sleep 1; done'
```

<text-box name="Quotes" variant="hint">

If you are command prompt (Windows) user you must use double quotes around the script i.e. `podman run -d -it --name looper ubuntu sh -c "while true; do date; sleep 1; done"`. The quote or double-quote may haunt you later during the course.

</text-box>

- The first part, `podman run -d`. Should be familiar by now, run container detached.

- Followed by `-it` is short for `-i` and `-t`. Also familiar, `-it` allows you to interact with the container by using the command line.

- Because we ran the container with `--name looper`, we can now reference it easily.

- The image is `ubuntu` and what follows it is the command given to the container.

And to check that it's running, run `podman container ls`

Let's follow `-f` the output of logs with

```console
$ podman logs -f looper
  Thu Feb  4 15:51:29 UTC 2021
  Thu Feb  4 15:51:30 UTC 2021
  Thu Feb  4 15:51:31 UTC 2021
  ...
```

Let's test pausing the looper without exiting or stopping it. In another terminal run `podman pause looper`. Notice how the logs output has paused in the first terminal. To unpause run `podman unpause looper`.

Keep the logs open and attach to the running container from the second terminal using 'attach':

```console
$ podman attach looper
  Mon Jan 15 19:26:54 UTC 2018
  Mon Jan 15 19:26:55 UTC 2018
  ...
```

Now you have process logs (STDOUT) running in two terminals. Now press control+c in the attached window. The container is stopped because the process is no longer running.

If we want to attach to a container while making sure we don't close it from the other terminal we can specify to not attach STDIN with `--no-stdin` option. Let's start the stopped container with `podman start looper` and attach to it with `--no-stdin`.

Then try control+c.

```console
$ podman start looper

$ podman attach --no-stdin looper
  Mon Jan 15 19:27:54 UTC 2018
  Mon Jan 15 19:27:55 UTC 2018
  ^C
```

The container will continue running. Control+c now only disconnects you from the STDOUT.

To enter a container, we can start a new process in it.

```console
$ podman exec -it looper bash

  root@2a49df3ba735:/# ps aux

  USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
  root         1  0.2  0.0   2612  1512 pts/0    Ss+  12:36   0:00 sh -c while true; do date; sleep 1; done
  root        64  1.5  0.0   4112  3460 pts/1    Ss   12:36   0:00 bash
  root        79  0.0  0.0   2512   584 pts/0    S+   12:36   0:00 sleep 1
  root        80  0.0  0.0   5900  2844 pts/1    R+   12:36   0:00 ps aux
```

From the `ps aux` listing we can see that our `bash` process got PID (process ID) of 64.

Now that we're inside the container it behaves as you'd expect from ubuntu, and we can exit the container with `exit` and then either kill or stop the container.

Our looper won't stop for a SIGTERM signal sent by a stop command. To terminate the process, stop follows the SIGTERM with a SIGKILL after a grace period. In this case, it's simply faster to use kill.

```console
$ podman kill looper
$ podman rm looper
```

Running the previous two commands is basically equivalent to running `podman rm --force looper`

Let's start another process with `-it` and add `--rm` in order to remove it automatically after it has exited. The `--rm` ensures that there are no garbage containers left behind. It also means that `podman start` can not be used to start the container after it has exited.

```console
$ podman run -d --rm -it --name looper-it ubuntu sh -c 'while true; do date; sleep 1; done'
```

Now let's attach to the container and hit control+p, control+q to detach us from the STDOUT.

```console
$ podman attach looper-it

  Mon Jan 15 19:50:42 UTC 2018
  Mon Jan 15 19:50:43 UTC 2018
  ^P^Qread escape sequence
```

Instead, if we had used ctrl+c, it would have sent a kill signal followed by removing the container as we specified `--rm` in `podman run` command.

<exercise name="Exercise 1.3: Secret message">

Now that we've warmed up it's time to get inside a container while it's running!

Image `devopspodmanuh/simple-web-service:ubuntu` will start a container that outputs logs into a file.
Go inside the container and use `tail -f ./text.log` to follow the logs.
Every 10 seconds the clock will send you a "secret message".

Submit the secret message and command(s) given as your answer.

</exercise>

<exercise name="Exercise 1.4: Missing dependencies">

Start a ubuntu image with the process `sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'`

You will notice that a few things required for proper execution are missing. Be sure to remind yourself which flags
to use so that the read actually waits for input.

> Note also that curl is NOT installed in the container yet. You will have to install it from inside of the container.

Test inputting `helsinki.fi` into the application. It should respond with something like

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>301 Moved Permanently</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Moved Permanently</h1>
    <p>The document has moved <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/">here</a>.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

This time return the command you used to start process and the command(s) you used to fix the ensuing problems.

* This exercise has multiple solutions, if the curl for helsinki.fi works then it's done. Can you figure out other (smart) solutions?
